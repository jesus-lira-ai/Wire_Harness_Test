## 💡 WHY GITHUB IS SECURE FOR YOUR COMPANY

**Concerns about "GitHub" and security?**

✅ **Private repos are truly private**
- Only you can see the files
- Not searchable on Google
- Not visible to other GitHub users
- Just like having a private folder on your PC

✅ **Used by Fortune 500 companies**
- Microsoft owns GitHub
- NASA uses it
- Major corporations use private GitHub repos

✅ **Password protected deployment**
- Even if someone finds your Netlify URL
- They need the password
- You control who has access

✅ **Better than email**
- Emails with PDFs can be forwarded
- This portal requires password
- You can change password anytime

## 🤔 COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Is GitHub safe for confidential drawings?**  
A: YES - Private repos are truly private. Plus password protection on Netlify.

**Q: Will IT be mad?**  
A: No - You're using external hosting for vendor collaboration (common practice). Not touching corporate infrastructure.

**Q: What if I want to revoke access?**  
A: Change the password in Netlify settings. Takes 10 seconds.

**Q: Can I use a custom domain?**  
A: Yes! Point your own domain to Netlify (e.g., drawings.yourcompany.com). Optional.

**Q: What if Netlify goes down?**  
A: 99.9% uptime. If it ever goes down, you have backup in GitHub. Can redeploy to Vercel in 5 minutes.

**Q: Can multiple vendors use this?**  
A: Yes! All use same password, or you can set up individual passwords with Netlify's paid plan ($19/mo).

**Q: How do I add 100 more drawings?**  
A: Edit `index.html`, copy a table row, paste it 100 times, change the data. Or I can create a script to auto-generate from a spreadsheet.
